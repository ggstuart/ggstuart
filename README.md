### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸŒ± I'm working on a number of public and private projects at the moment including:

- CTEC3905    - course materials for "Front End Web Development" final year undergraduate module
- GAMR1520    - course materials for "Markup languages and scripting" first year undergraduate module
- JS Game Dev - Book manuscript and tutorials for creating Asteroids clone (JS canvas)
- EDI-Net     - An energy management system for automating analysis and visualisation of smart meter data
- pyEMIS2     - An inverse modelling and analysis system for smart meter data (with deep learning capability coming soon?)
- MECS        - A data logging system based on raspberry PI's

If you are interested in any of these projects then [contact me](https://ggstuart.com/contact.html), I'm always looking for critics, collaborators, users and help.
